Since it is unknown what geometry Hurrevac uses to determine if a point makes landfall we will make our own.

Land polygon downloaded from https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html on 2020-05-29.
Projected to EPSG 4326 to match Hazus and storm track lat/long values (using ArcMap 10.5).
Converted to GeoJSON using http://ogre.adc4gis.com/
