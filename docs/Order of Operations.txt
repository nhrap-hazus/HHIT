Important order of operations in storm processing (hurrevac_storm.py):

 Fill in intermediate values

 MaxWindSpeed (convert knots to mph and apply HurrevacVmaxFactor; interim advisories are in knots)

 RadiusToHurrWindType (miles, based on maxwindspeed) should run before inland adjustment to maxwindspeed.

 RadiusToXWinds (34, 50, 64)

 Interim advisory RadiusToXWinds, get previous row's value.

 ZeroOut RadiusToXWinds (based on HurrWindType)

 Inland adjustment to MaxWindSpeed (mph and HurrevacVmaxFactor applied) adjusted by 1.15 if inland=1 (first inland point not adjusted)

 OptimizeTrack runs after all cacluations are finished and forecast points appended to main dataframe and before loading to sql server.
